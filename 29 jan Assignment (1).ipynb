    "    Python is open source, meaning it's developed under an OSI-approved license and can be used for commercial purposes. \n",
    "Large library support :\n",
    "    Python has a large number of third-party libraries, which are pre-written code that can be included in projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science :\n",
    "    Python is used for data science and artificial intelligence (AI) because it's simple, stable, and consistent. It also has libraries and frameworks that speed up development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Community support :\n",
    "    Python has a large and active community that provides resources, tutorials, and documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integration capabilities :\n",
    "    Python can integrate with other languages and technologies, such as C/C++, Java, databases, and web services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Portability :\n",
    "    Python programs can run across various operating systems without modifying the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing :\n",
    "    Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables don't need to be explicitly declared with their data types. This results in more flexible and concise code. \n",

    "Q14.How is memory managed in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Python manages memory through a private heap, a memory manager, and a variety of methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "Private heap: \n",
    "A portion of memory that is exclusive to the Python process and stores all Python objects and data structures. The size of the private heap can grow and shrink as needed. \n",
